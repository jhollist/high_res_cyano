# Provisional Data Access Addendum

## Introduction {#introduction}

Research projects are often conducted in areas that are of high interest to a variety of stakeholders and they are often interested in seeing preliminary data and results as they come available (i.e. provisional) instead of at the end of a project when final publications are prepared and submitted. Making this provisional data available benefits the research in that it increases the likelihood that other users may uncover potential quality issues with the data. It also benefits the project as we are providing useful information to our partners and stakeholders in a time frame that is more beneficial for their end uses. This addendum provides the details of how we will make data from our high-resolution cyanobacteria research available and how we will conduct preliminary quality control checks as those data are collected.

## Data {#data}

There are several data sources associated with this project and we plan to make all of them available as provisional data when they come available. All data are collected in two ponds on Cape Cod, Shubael and Hamblin Ponds.  Each data source is listed below with a brief description, list of parameters, and the approximate frequency at which they are collected.  More details on each are included in the QAPP.

- Water quality buoys: The buoys are NexSens CB-150s and are equipped with a YSI EXO2 Multi- parameter sonde, a Trios NICOs optical nitrate sensor, and an Airmar 200WX weather station.  Data is logged and transmitted via the NexSens X2-CB data logger via cellular network.  All data are collected every 15 minutes.  The buoys are located at the approximate center of each waterbody.
  - Parameters: nitrate, water temperature, pH, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, chlorophyll, phycocyanin, fdom, barometric pressure, air temperature, wind direction, wind speed
- Fast Limnological Automated Measurements (FLAMe):  The FLAMe is an on-board flowthrough system that provides detailed spatial data of the same water quality parameters that are measured by the water quality buoys.  We follow a pre-determined grid within the waterbody and take a measurement of each parameter every 1 second, except for nitrate which is measured every 10 seconds.  Location data are corrected based on the overall FLAMe residence time and sensor response time.
  - Parameters: nitrate, water temperature, pH, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, chlorophyll, phycocyanin, fdom
- EXO2 sonde data: At five locations within each waterbody, the buoy location and at four littoral locations, we also collect data from a hand-held EXO2 multi-parameter sonde.  These data provide information on possible drift in the buoy measurements and serve as a check for the FLAMe measurements.  The same paramters are measured; however, nitrate is measured with a different sensor than on the FLAMe and buoy, the YSI nitra LED.
  - Parameters: nitrate, water temperature, pH, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, chlorophyll, phycocyanin, fdom
- Water quality grab samples:  Grab samples area also collected at the five locations where hand-held sonde data is collected.  Grab samples are used to validate and transform some of the sensor based measurements as well as for measuring other parameters that we are not able to measure with sensors.
  - Parameters: extracted chlorophyll, extracted phycocyanin, nutrients (dissolved and total), microcystin
- Zooplankton and Phytoplankton: At the buoy site only, 150 and 50 Âµm plankton tows are performed to examing zooplankton, and whole water samples are used for phytoplankton
  - Parameters: Genus level abundance for both zoo- and phyto-plankton.

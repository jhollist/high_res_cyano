# Shubael and Hamblin Pond Research Projects

Starting in June of 2021, the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the Barnstable Clean Water Coalition (BCWC) will be conducting research in both Shubael and Hamblin Ponds to better understand Harmful Algal Blooms.  You may have even noticed the most conspicuous part of their efforts, the yellow water quality buoys near the center of each pond. Also, on a monthly basis, the BCWC will be flying a drone on Shubael Pond to collect water color data for HAB monitoring.  To find out more, you may reach out to the the USEPA project co-leads, Stephen Shivers (shivers.stephen@epa.gov) or Jeff Hollister (hollister.jeff@epa.gov). For a better understanding of Harmful Algal Blooms in general look at the [US EPA's Cyanobacterial HABs site](https://www.epa.gov/cyanohabs).

# Problem

It is generally accepted that changes in nutrients and temperature can impact the water quality of freshwater systems such as lakes, ponds, and reservoirs, but how these changes occur over time and across space are not yet well understood.  

# Research Plans

Starting in the summer of 2021, researchers from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Atlantic Coastal Environmental Sciences Division (USEPA ACESD) will be conducting research on harmful algal blooms (HABs), particularly cyanobacterial HABs.  This work will focus on two Cape Cod ponds, Shubael Pond and Hamblin Pond.

The USEPA ACESD researchers will be using three different methods to assess HABs.  First, the researchers will be deploying a water quality buoy in both Shubael and Hamblin pond.  These buoys will take a reading every 15 minutes and provide information on physical, chemical, and biological properties (e.g. water temperature, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, phycocyanin, and nitrate) which help track the changes in the algal populations.  Second, ACESD staff are building a system, modeled after the FLAMe (https://flame.wisc.edu), that will measure the same physical, chemical and biological properties approximately every 20 meters across the pond.  Lastly, water samples will be collected 1-2 times per month and will be analyzed for nutrients, cyanotoxins, and algal and zooplankton communities.

# Research Impact

These detailed spatial and temporal datasets will provide insights into how drivers of algal blooms change and, importantly, how potentially harmful species, like cyanobacteria, respond to these changing drivers.  This type of information is needed to guide management efforts and to hopefully reduce the occurrence of future bloom events.

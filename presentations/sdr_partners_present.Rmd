## Where, When

- Shubael Pond and Hamblin Pond
- June to November
  - Started 2021

## Why

- Why High Resolution?
- Why in Shubael?
- Why in Hamblin?

## What: HABS over time

- Buoys
  - Nexsens CB-150 
    - Multiparameter sonde 
      - Temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, tubirdity, FDOM, chlorophyll, phycocyanin
    - Optical nitrate sensor
    - Weather station
  - FieldKit Water with solar
    - Temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity
- Fixed location
- Every 15 minutes

## What: HABS over space

- Fast Limnological Automated Measurments (FLAMe)
  - University of Wisconsin Center for Limnology: <https://flame.wisc.edu>
  - On-board flow through system
  - Multiparameter Sonde
  - Optical nitrate sensor
  - Measurements approx. every 20 meters
  - Twice a month
  - Work in progress!

## Preliminary Results
